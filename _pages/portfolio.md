As part of my Purwadhika Final Project, I conducted comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and built a Customer Segmentation model using the Olist E-Commerce dataset.
I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups. These segmentation can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies more effectively based on distinct customer behavior.
