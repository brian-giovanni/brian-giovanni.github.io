## Beyond Data
**Badminton**<br>
When I’m not deep in code or exploring data patterns, I’m probably out doing something that keeps me moving.
I believe to live is to move your body, and playing badminton is the answer for me. I've been playing badminton since I was still in primary school and I never get bored of it. It’s more than just a sport, it’s how I de-stress, stay active, and have fun with friends. There’s something satisfying about the rhythm of a good rally, the quick decision-making, and the burst of energy every game demands. It’s my weekly reset button and a reminder to stay agile and active on and off the court.

**Exploring New Places** <br>
I also love exploring new places. Whether it’s a weekend walk through an unfamiliar part of town or a longer trip to a different country, I’m always up for discovering something new. I enjoy exploring interesting scenes, trying local food, and noticing the little cultural quirks that make each place unique. Travel keeps my perspective wide and made my curiosity sharp — just like data does.
